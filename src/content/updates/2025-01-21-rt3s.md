# Introduction

I've had the Retevis RT3S since 2022 and in this time It's become my default recomendation for people looking to upgrade from a Baofeng UV-5R or Quansheng UV-K5/6

This review will be focusing on the RT3S in conjunction with the OpenGD77 firmware. Although I have used the radio for a few months with the stock firmware, I believe the OpenGD77 firmware is much better for hobby use compared to the stock firmware. I will go into more detail in the firmware section.

The Retevis RT3S is a rebadged version of the TYT MD-UV380. The UV380 has had some hardware changes over the years such as a "10W" variant and a variant that supports AES. Because of these variants I typically suggest the RT3S over the UV380 just because there's [less risk of buying something that's unsupported](https://www.opengd77.com/viewtopic.php?t=4685)

# Features

- very good dynamic talkgroup support
- themes, start up screens and tones
- satellite operation with doppler shift support:: woag

# Firmware

Some notable differences from stock:

- VFO mode in the stock firmware isn't accessible when displaying channel names
- The stock firmware requires navigating menu hell to edit channels
- OpenGD77 doesn't support dual-watch, This is because the hardware of the radio doesn't actually support the feature, and the stock firmware just rapidly scans both channels.
- OpenGD77 doesn't support DMR text messaging
- OpenGD77 doesn't support encryption (Most ham users won't have use for this, but some hobbyists have licenses for commercial spectrum where this is useful)

Although OpenGD77 is fantastic firmware, it's not as "open" as most software developers are used to. There are only yearly source releases under a non-commercial license. I'd love to see the project managed in a git repository to facilitate external contributions and forks.

# Other Mods

## OpenRTX

[OpenRTX](https://openrtx.org/) is a truly open source firmware for the RT3S though is less mature than OpenGD77

## M17

For those looking to delve into new digital modes the RT3S can do M17 with some hardware mods and OpenRTX

## Adding GPS to non-GPS models

If you bought a model without GPS and decide you want GPS support on your radio for APRS, some folks on the OpenGD77 forum have been discussing ways to add 3rd party GPS modules to the radio.

I tried to do this mod twice, but damaged the GPS module both times while attempting to close the radio, and eventually made a hole in the housing trying to make more room, It's definitely not the easiest mod to do.

## USB-C Charging

Oh yeah! someone made a USB-C rechargable battery which I feel turns this into the perfect travel radio. I suggest looking for "uv380 usb-c battery" on aliexpress to find it

# RF characteristics

While looking for spurious emissions information I discovered that [the FCC ID printed on my radio Doesn't Exist????](https://www.opengd77.com/viewtopic.php?t=4391)

Uppon reaching out to Retevis for questions they replied with the following

> Hi friend,

> Hope you all well.

> RT3S's FCC is currently in the process of application. We apologize for the inconvenience.

> Hope you understand.

This is suspect because the RT3S has been out since at least 2021 (Source: [The Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20210421175705/https://www.retevis.com/RT3S-Dual-Band-DMR-Radio-Built-in-GPS)) with reviews dating back to 2018 (Source: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/sHymie9n_38)),

Although [the RT3S isn't FCC approved](https://www.opengd77.com/viewtopic.php?t=4391) a variant of the [UV380 is](https://fccid.io/POD-MDUV380/).

For those who truly care about FCC Certification, installing custom firmware on the radio would void any FCC approvals anyways.

In absence of FCC documents, I found [TinySA measurements](https://www.opengd77.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3006&p=26209#p26209) taken by SA0BUX of the OpenGD77 forum that seem to indicate that it's not got any spurious emissions

I have noticed however that the radio behaves weirdly on 160.3650 MHz (AAR Channel 017). It seems to open squelch momentarily when pressing buttons or scanning. This issue has appeared on multiple units I've tested and in completely different cities.

TODO: Get a recording of this occuring on Sarah's RT3S as well as mine.

A friend tested the stock antenna and found that it had a very low SWR of something like 1.2 on UHF\[Verify]

TODO: Make a friend with a good fuckin spectrum analyser take a look at it

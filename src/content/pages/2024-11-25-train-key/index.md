_I'm not entirely sure of my motivation behind this, but I decided I wanted one._

**Please don't do anything stupid with this information. I made these as a novelty and do not plan to use them without permission.**

The Toronto Transit Commission and GO Transit seem to both share a utility key. Measuring the socket it's a 8 mm square hole with little wings to prevent any old piece of square bar from fitting. The TTC employees call it the "Cab Key"; probably because it also opens the operator's cab.

A square hole about 8 mm on each side with little triangles in the center of each face protruding around 1.5 mm into the square hole preventing any off the shelf square wrench from fitting](key-hole.jpg)

I got lucky and the local train museum happened to have one and allowed me to measure it.

I made each "layer" to scale in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) by setting the canvas to the exact dimensions, and used the coordinates system to position things. I then imported the SVGs from Inkscape into [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and extruded them. I then exported a triangle shape from inkscape and used the SVG revolve tool to cut bevels at the borders of each layer to help with locating when inserting the key. Then I added a loop for a key ring.

Initial tests were 3D printed in PLA and after confirming fitment I sent the model to be 3D printed in metal. Each key ended up costing about C$15 at [JLC3DP](https://jlc3dp.com/) (not sponsored) and I printed 3 extra to give to friends.

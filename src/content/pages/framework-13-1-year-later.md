The great:

- Battery life
- Display
  - Resolution
  - Refresh rate
- Keyboard feel
- Form factor
- Wifi

The good

- Performance
- Speakers (Better than the YouTubers say they are)

The bad:

- Trackpad is shit
- Microphone is ass
- Bezel cracking
- Hinges too weak
- Marks on the display from falling down the stairs
- Fan failure
- Keyboard failure

The terrible

- Laptop's frame is WAY too flexible and should be redesigned
  - Likely the root cause behind 4 the issues I've had

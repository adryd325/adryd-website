I'm autistic, and I heard somewhere that autistic people like to be prepared for any situation. I definitely see that in myself and tend to overengineer what I daily carry.

I figured I'd share what I carry in case others like to plan this sort of thing, or in case people are interested

## Purse

## Backpack

All of the above items usually live in my backpack. My backpack is a Donut Macaroon Backpack in "Lake". It has a large main compartment with a laptop sleeve, and some zipper pockets for small items

Attached to my backpack strap is a carabiner a friend gave me which I often clip my water bottle to

### Front Pouch

- Flipper Zero
- Expo Dry Erase Marker
- Train Keys
- Small plastic case with medications
  - Ibuprofin
  - Acetaminophin
  - Benadril
  - Lactase Ensyme: I'm not personally lactose intolerant, but a bunch of friends are, and some dont carry it
  - Pepcid Antacid
  - Prescription meds are omitted for privacy reasons

### Main compartment

- Umbrella
- Water bottle: Sometimes a nice thermoflask 40oz bottle, other times its just a disposable waterbottle that I reuse for a few weeks

#### Zipper pocket

- Airspy R2
- USB-A to Micro-B cable
- Anker 67W GaN wall charger

#### Velcro pocket

- Earbuds
- Ugreen 3.5mm and USB-C adapter: so I can charge my phone and listen to music at the same time

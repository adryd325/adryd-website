I'm autistic, and I heard somewhere that autistic people like to be prepared for any situation. I definitely see that in myself and tend to overengineer what I daily carry.

I figured I'd share what I carry in case others like to plan this sort of thing, or in case people are interested.

The photos are a snapshot in time of what I carried. My daily carry evolves as my needs change. It's much easier to update the list than to take new photos each time.

## Backpack

All of the above items usually live in my backpack. My backpack is a Donut Macaroon Backpack in "Lake". It has a large main compartment with a laptop sleeve, and some zipper pockets for small items

Attached to my backpack strap is a carabiner a friend gave me which I often clip my water bottle to

- Train Keys
- Altoids tin with medications

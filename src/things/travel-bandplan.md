# Travel Simplex Band Plan

| Name        | Frequency    | PL Tone  | Bandwidth | Comment |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------- | --------- | --- |
| VHF Meowing | 146.4300 MHz | None     | 25 KHz    | [15 KHz spacing only](https://www.k0nr.com/wordpress/2020/08/simplex-channels-2m/)
| UHF Meowing | 446.1000 MHz | None     | 25 KHz    |
| FRS Meowing | 462.7125 MHz | 103.5 Hz | 12.5 KHz  | FRS 7
| VHF Barking | 146.4600 MHz | None     | 25 KHz    | Alternate
| UHF Barking | 446.1500 MHz | None     | 25 KHz    | Alternate
| FRS Barking | 462.6500 MHz | 103.5 Hz | 12.5 KHz  | FRS 19. Alternate


PL tone 103.5 Hz is privacy code 13 on Motorola TalkAbout FRS radios

**Note:** I reverted my decision about using PL tones on amateur band simplex. It's good to know if there are other people using your frequency. PL tones are helpful on FRS where there's quite often other traffic.

## Digital modes

These are mostly just here for fun :3

<p class="lead">TL:DR; I won't send lawyers after you unless you're pretending to be me. I include content from other people on this website and that may be have different licenses. Attribution is very much appreciated but not required.</p>

Most portions of this website are dual-licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/adryd325/adryd-website/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT.txt) and [CC BY 4.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). See exceptions below

## Exceptions
 - **Files in /public/buttons**  
 These files have ambiguous licenses as they are designed by many of my friends. If you desire to use these, please reach out to the url that the 88x31 points to on my [home page](/).
 - **The "adryd" logo mark, word mark and 88x31s**  
 These images are &copy; All Rights Reserved. I think they also have implicit trademark rights? I'm not a lawyer, and I won't go after you if you use these marks appropriately to refer to me, my projects or this website.
 - **Fonts**  
 [Pretendard](https://github.com/orioncactus/pretendard), [IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex) and [Source Serif](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif) typefaces are licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1. The full license text can be found at their respective GitHub pages
 - **Some images**  
 For example, the quoted screenshot from Jasper Boerstra on [88x31 notes](/pages/88x31-notes/) do not belong to me. I'm using them with an ambiguous license in hopes that their use is transformative. Generally these images will be obvious as they will be attributed to someone else.
## Usage Guidelines

I can't really stop you from doing the following as the licenses above are intentionally very permissive.
 - I'd generally prefer if you don't run AI scrapers on this website and associated repository.
 - Attribution is really appreciated!

Okay, So say you're visiting friends for a week or something and you have an AirTag. Every couple hours they will get a notification "AirTag Found Moving With You". That is mildly annoying. Now you, being a friend who cares, wants to figure out how your friends can disable this notification. 

// ^ Does this make sense as a scenario? many of the complaints are things that I have and my friends may not necesarily share those concerns

Let's explore our options

## Mute the notification for 24 hours

 - Have to do it every 24 hours

## Disable AirTag notifications all together

 - Still wanna be notified in the case I wind up with someone else's item, or an AirTag slipped in my bag

## Share your (AirTag's) location, with your friend

 - Now in my case I'm fine with doing this for the duration of the visit
 - Doesn't always make sense, imagine living with a roommate who you hang out with a fair bit, but don't want to share your location at all times

## Create an iCloud Family with your friend

 - Yeah but I'm already in an iCloud family with my parents
 - Involves sharing purchases/billing

## Familliar locations

 - Don't want to enable this because stolen device protection
    - Not that does anything


What I propose
 - A way to disable notifications for 30, 60 or 90 days
 - Physical scan of the AirTag is necesary
 - Shows up in Find My but only if you're nearby (?)
 - Notification on cold boot, similar to Shortcuts (?)

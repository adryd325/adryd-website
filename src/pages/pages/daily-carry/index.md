I tend to like to be a bit overprepared

## Purse

I have one of those Lululemon Everywhere belt bags that everyone seems to have. It has two zippered compartments: one on top and one on the back. The main compartment has three interior mesh organizing pockets: two small ones on the front side of the bag and one large one on the back side.

My purse is made to be able to be carried standalone. When doing so I'll often toss in my earbuds and usb-c earbud adapter, as well clip my water bottle onto the strap with a carabiner.

I usually like to keep a USB-A plug to USB-A recepticle adapter in my purse, but I lost the one I had. I also used to have an Anker PowerCore 10000 which was recalled recently, and haven't been able to afford a replacement.

In the main compartment I have:
- Screwdriver: One of those promotional screwdrivers they used to hand out at trade shows
- Zebra SARASA clip gel pen: Cheap to replace if ever I lose it
- My wallet

In one of the smaller mesh organizers in the main compartment I have
- USB-C to USB-C cable
- Fiskars folding scissors: I use these almost every day.
- Nail clippers
- Lip Seal: Eucerin Aquaphor

Between the two small mesh organizers I've clipped
- Rovyvon A1 flashlight: USB-C rechargable little flashlight

And in the other small mesh organizer pocket I have
- Microfiber cloth
- Tissues
- Emergency meds
- Alcohol swabs
- Salt and pepper

In the large mesh organizer I have a small mesh bag with
- USB-C plug to USB-A recepticle adapter
- USB-B plug to USB-C recepticle adapter
- USB-B mini plug to USB-C recepticle adapter
- USB-B micro plug to USB-C recepticle adapter
- SanDisk Ultra Dual Drive 128 GB: Flashdrive with [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html). Has both USB-A and USB-C ends

And, in the back zippered compartment I keep
- USB-C to Lightning cable
- AirTag
- Blue key fob
- Black key fob

## Wallet

I have a small wallet with 3 zipper compartments, and one open pocket. There are 2 zipper compartments on one side of the wallet. The top of the wallet has a larger zip compartment capable of holding cards, and the side opposite of the 2 zipper slots has an open pocket.

It looks a bit like [this one I found on AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007336693975.html), but this one looks to be missing the open pocket.

In the smallest zipper pocket:
- House key
- YubiKey 5 NFC

The 2nd front zipper pocket has:
- Coins

The main zipper pocket has cards I use less often, since cards are hard to add and remove from it:
- PRESTO card (transit card for Toronto area)
- Credit card
- 2nd credit card
- Provincial health insurance card
- NEXUS card

The open pocket has:
- Cash bills
- Radio license
- Bandages
- Debit card
- Provincial ID card

## Pouch

This pouch came free with my old backpack, and it seems to be discontinued. It's some sort of Herschel supply pouch in a limited edition Hoffman fabric.

I keep smaller stuff in here that isn't essential to my day-to-day life. I will leave this bag behind on days where I know I won't need it.

## Backpack

I chose a [Doughnut Macaroon](https://www.jetpens.com/Doughnut-Macaroon-Large-Backpack-Reborn-Lake/pd/42466) large backpack in their Lake color. I chose the darker color as I figured it would show dirt less, and I was correct in my assumption. It has way more organization options in comparison to my previous backpack, however I wish it had loops of webbing on the backpack straps to clip radios to.

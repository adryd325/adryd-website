I'm autistic, and I heard somewhere that autistic people like to be prepared for any situation. I definitely see that in myself and tend to overengineer what I daily carry.

I figured I'd share what I carry in case others like to plan this sort of thing, or in case people are interested

## Purse

My purse is a Lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag. It works just fine as a purse, has 3 mesh organizer slots in the main compartment and a second zipper compartment on the back side

I can carry this standalone, but often put it in my backpack when going to class or on days out

### Main compartment

- Sharpie S Gel Pen: Cheap enough that if I loose it I wouldnt care, writes well enough
- One of those screwdrivers you used to see at trade shows: Has phillips and flathead bits and works well enough

#### Left pouch

- Yubikey 5
- 128GB SanDisk flash drive: Has Ventoy and a whole bunch of distros
- Anker PowerCore 10000 Power Bank
- USB A Plug to C Recepticle (plugged into Power Bank)
- Apple 1M USB C to C cable

#### Right pouch

- Portable Tissues
- Optico Cleaning Wipe: The ones I get are from costco and are intended for glasses, but the main ingredient is alcohol and thus they work as an alcohol wipe in a pinch
- Nail file
- Nail clippers
- Tweezers

  - USB C plug to A recepticle adapter
  - USB C plug to Micro B recepticle adapter

## Pencil Case

My pencil case came free with my backpack and I'm unsure what model it is, but it's from Herschel and doesn't have much room

- Sharpie Fine Point Permanent Marker: Maybe I should get rid of this cause conspiracy charges are cringe
- Graphgear 500 Mechanical Pencil
- Pilot Frixon Highlighter
- Sharpie S Gel Pen
- Lamy Safari Fountain Pen
- Pentel Dry Erase Marker

## Tech Pouch

This tech pouch has a similar story to my pencil case. It came free with my ~~xbox~~ backpack, however it is far more spacious and has a lovely flower design

- 3ft Ethernet Cable
- Telescopic BNC UHF Antenna: I got it for 10 dollars at a hamfest

## Backpack

All of the above items usually live in my backpack. My backpack is a Herschel Settlement Backpack in black. It has a large main compartment with a (not padded) laptop sleeve and water bottle pouch which is too small for a water bottle. I would not recommend. It also has a small front pouch

### Front Pouch

- NIVEA Black & White Invisible roll on anti-perspirant: I carry this specific deoderant because it's stored in a glass bottle and doesn't get crushed like paste deoderants, and doesnt squeeze out everywhere like gel deoderants.

- Small plastic case with medications: I carry this both for myself and for my friends
  - Ibuprofin
  - Acetaminophin
  - Benadril
  - Lactase Ensyme: I'm not personally lactose intolerant, but a bunch of friends are, and some dont carry it
  - Pepcid Antacid
  - Flipper Zero: Maybe I should get rid of this cause conspiracy charges are cringe

### Main compartment

- Umbrella

## Floating

This stuff doesn't have a dedicated place, but gets brought with me pretty much everywhere

- Framework 13 AMD 7640U, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 2.8k Display
- iPhone 15
- 3M N95 Mask
- Anker 67W GaN wall charger
  - Ugreen USB C to C cable
  - Anker USB A to C cable
- Earbuds
- Ugreen 3.5mm and USB-C adapter: so I can charge my phone and listen to music at the same time

## Design
- subtle dot grid background, like a page from my notebook
- draw out "hi, i'm ari" and trace it in inkscape
- draw it smaller for bolder trace, may need macro lens
- page borders
- more color, i love skip's website's use of accent color for background
and text color
- more icons
  - custom icons in the style of silk icons

## Compatibility
- perhaps a seperate generator for legacy browsers (targeting ie6)
- rewrite oneko to be entirely ie6 supported

## new footer ramble

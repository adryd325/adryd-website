## Global marketplaces

Equivelants to Ebay from around the world. Useful when searching obscure things. If you actually need to buy something from most of these sites, you'll probably have to arrange re-shipping, as they typically target within their country.

Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist seem to be available around the world, always keep those options in mind. Also be sure to check different countries' Ebay, like ebay.com.au, ebay.co.uk, etc for items only shipped to that region
